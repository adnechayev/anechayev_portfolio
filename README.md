This repository contains projects reflecting a multitude of statistical analysis methods using various types of data. In addition, I've been passionate to work on a project involving natural language processing, specifically topic modeling using LDA and TF-IDF models. Here is a quick rundown of the various statistical methods employed:

1. **Chi-Square Test**
   With a chi-square test, you can discover whether a relationship exists between two categorical variables. In this project, we looked at user click-rate for a given version of a website to see if one version was favored (more clicks) over the other. Using a contingency table, we determined that there was a high likelihood that the newer website version was favorable to the old one.

2. **Multiple Linear Regression**
