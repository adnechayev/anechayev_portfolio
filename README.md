# Anthony's Portfolio
- This repository contains projects reflecting a multitude of statistical analysis methods using various types of data.
- In addition, I've been passionate to work on a project involving natural language processing, specifically topic modeling using LDA and TF-IDF models. Here is a quick rundown of the various statistical methods employed:

## Projects ðŸ“ˆ

1. **Chi-Square Test**

- With a chi-square test, you can discover whether a relationship exists between two categorical variables. In this project, we looked at user click-rate for a given version of a website to see if one version was favored (more clicks) over the other. Using a contingency table, we determined that there was a high likelihood that the newer website version was favorable to the old one.

2. **Multiple Linear Regression**

- A multivariable linear regression test aims to explore the relationship between more than 2 variables. In this project, we employed several tools from the SK-Learn module to run a linear regression between a car's features and its carbon dioxide emission.

3. **Student T-Test**

- To determine whether the difference of means between two groups is significant or by mere chance, we utilize the Student T-test. Using both a linear regression model and the T-test, this project looks at differences in housing prices in Boston as a result of various features; location, units built, proportion of business acres, and more. In particular, we looked at the effect of whether the tract bordered the Charles River or not to see if there was a correlation in price.

4. **Topic Modeling**

- This project looks at a natural language processing technique called topic modeling using LDA and TF-IDF methods. These methods generate topics from terms that share a relevancy, in order to show us an overarching theme in a corpus of text. Here we looked at popular artist Khalid's lyrics and using the package pyLDAvis, we were able to visualize the topic clusters as well as term frequency to see which lyrics were most relevent to a given topic.

5. **K-means Clustering**

-K-means clustering is an unsupervised machine learning algorithm that groups data points based on their Euclidian distance from their respective cluster (k). In this project, I looked at credit card transaction details to see if my K-means model is a good fit for correctly labeling a given transaction as fraudulent or not. With a high inertia value of 84893, the highest accuracy reading I reached was 50% unfortunately - indicating that this model was not a good fit for the dataset.
